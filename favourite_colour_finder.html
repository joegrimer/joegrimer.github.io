<h3>The need for peace - Jerry F. Spinkler</h3>
    <p>As we all know, our neighbouring country is a peaceloving place. For 43 years now, they have held the Sirinian Guard as a preventative masure to crime. Their structure of government is simplistic, focusing on preventative measures, on bypassing the ills of humanity. This is an example sentence provided to add to the length of this somewhat-meaningless article. As we all know, our neighbouring country is a peaceloving place.

<p>Thanks for reading our fascinating new paper. Please write-in any additions (or even contributions) that you may like to make. I welcome those additions. They help us create a greater world through the "logos", the word that we write could just prevent the future from being any bleaker than it could be, and perhaps, with some effort, a little better!
