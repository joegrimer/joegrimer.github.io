	article = "John ran across the green plane. He didn't like the grass, but he loved the sun, the rain and the wind in his teeth. There was a tree at the end of the field. The tree spoke to him. The tree told him to come. The tree did not want to eat him. But he wanted to climb the tree. However, deep in the grass was hidden a snake, ready to bite those who wished to climb the tree. The tree has long curved branches. The snake was black with green stripes. You are alone. He wants to see you. The boy had red trousers, and a green shirt. The boy was ignorant. The tree was strong. The snake was malicious. The snake was actually hungry. Maybe you are hungry. Maybe this story sounds silly. It's not supposed to be art. It's just for my little experiment, you see."
	article = "Theresa May has backed away from a pledge to require companies to put worker representatives on boards. Speaking to the CBI's annual conference, Mrs May said firms would not be forced to adopt the controversial proposal. 'This is not about mandating works councils, or the direct appointment of workers or trade union representatives on boards,' she said. Mrs May's pledge had met with a cool response from business lobby groups.The prime minister said there were 'other routes' that used existing board structures, but supplemented by advisory councils or panels. 'It will be a question of finding the model that works,' she said. Mrs May promised to shake-up corporate governance as part of her Conservative Party leadership campaign in July, and repeated the promise at last month's party conference when she said she planned to have 'not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well'. Asked if she had dropped plans for the direct appointment of workers on boards, Mrs May said she had 'clarified' that 'we want workers' representation on boards', but 'there are a number of ways in which that can be achieved.'She said the government would soon publish its plans to reform corporate governance, which would cover firms' accountability to shareholders, executive pay as well as proposals to ensure employees' voices were heard.In her speech to business leaders, Mrs May also pledged an extra £2bn a year in funding for scientific research and development by 2020."
	article="""
The gallows in my garden, people say,
Is new and neat and adequately tall;
I tie the noose on in a knowing way
As one that knots his necktie for a ball;
But just as all the neighbours--on the wall--
Are drawing a long breath to shout "Hurray!"
The strangest whim has seized me. . . . After all
I think I will not hang myself to-day.

To-morrow is the time I get my pay--
My uncle's sword is hanging in the hall--
I see a little cloud all pink and grey--
Perhaps the rector's mother will not call-- I fancy that I heard from Mr. Gall
That mushrooms could be cooked another way--
I never read the works of Juvenal--
I think I will not hang myself to-day.

The world will have another washing-day;
The decadents decay; the pedants pall;
And H.G. Wells has found that children play,
And Bernard Shaw discovered that they squall,
Rationalists are growing rational--
And through thick woods one finds a stream astray
So secret that the very sky seems small--
I think I will not hang myself to-day.

Envoi

Prince, I can hear the trumpet of Germinal,
The tumbrils toiling up the terrible way;
Even to-day your royal head may fall,
I think I will not hang myself to-day.

This much, O heaven—if I should brood or rave,
Pity me not; but let the world be fed,
Yea, in my madness if I strike me dead,
Heed you the grass that grows upon my grave.

If I dare snarl between this sun and sod,
Whimper and clamour, give me grace to own,
In sun and rain and fruit in season shown,
The shining silence of the scorn of God.

Thank God the stars are set beyond my power,
If I must travail in a night of wrath,
Thank God my tears will never vex a moth,
Nor any curse of mine cut down a flower.

Men say the sun was darkened: yet I had
Thought it beat brightly, even on—Calvary:
And He that hung upon the Torturing Tree
Heard all the crickets singing, and was glad.

When fishes flew and forests walked
And figs grew upon thorn,
Some moment when the moon was blood,
Then surely I was born;

With monstrous head and sickening cry
And ears like errant wings,
The devil's walking parody
On all four-footed things.

The tattered outlaw of the earth,
Of ancient crooked will;
Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb,
I keep my secret still.

Fools! For I also had my hour;
One far fierce hour and sweet:
There was a shout about my ears,
And palms before my feet.

The line breaks and the guns go under,
The lords and the lackeys ride the plain;
I draw deep breaths of the dawn and thunder,
And the whole of my heart grows young again.
For our chiefs said 'Done,' and I did not deem it;
Our seers said 'Peace,' and it was not peace;
Earth will grow worse till men redeem it,
And wars more evil, ere all wars cease.
But the old flags reel and the old drums rattle,
As once in my life they throbbed and reeled;
I have found my youth in the lost battle,
I have found my heart on the battlefield.
For we that fight till the world is free,
We are not easy in victory:
We have known each other too long, my brother,
And fought each other, the world and we.

And I dream of the days when work was scrappy,
And rare in our pockets the mark of the mint,
When we were angry and poor and happy,
And proud of seeing our names in print.
For so they conquered and so we scattered,
When the Devil road and his dogs smelt gold,
And the peace of a harmless folk was shattered;
When I was twenty and odd years old.
When the mongrel men that the market classes
Had slimy hands upon England's rod,
And sword in hand upon Afric's passes
Her last Republic cried to God.
For the men no lords can buy or sell,
They sit not easy when all goes well,
They have said to each other what naught can smother,
They have seen each other, our souls and hell.

It is all as of old, the empty clangour,
The Nothing scrawled on a five-foot page,
The huckster who, mocking holy anger,
Painfully paints his face with rage.
And the faith of the poor is faint and partial,
And the pride of the rich is all for sale,
And the chosen heralds of England's Marshal
Are the sandwich-men of the Daily Mail,
And the niggards that dare not give are glutted,
And the feeble that dare not fail are strong,
So while the City of Toil is gutted,
I sit in the saddle and sing my song.
For we that fight till the world is free,
We have no comfort in victory;
We have read each other as Cain his brother,
We know each other, these slaves and we.

Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode,
The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.
A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,
And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;
A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread
The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.

I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire,
And for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire;
But I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed
To straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made,
Where you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands,
The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.

His sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run
Behind him; and the hedges all strengthening in the sun?
The wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which,
But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch.
God pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear
The night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier.

My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage,
Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,
But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,
And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death;
For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,
Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.

Good morning Joe
 hullo
 wanted to get your thought on using utils yeesterday
 utils?
 like putting some methods in utils
for the passport bit
 yh, I think one of those nested functions could
I forgot what the second one was
 log_availability_error( )
check_for_fee_as_tax( )
 yh first one makes sense in utils… second maybe I guess…
in theory utils is for shared functions, i.e. functions used by more than one file
but I think it’s also fair to put functions that “could” be shared, if you see what I mean
like if you had a kids maths program
and only one lesson used base augmentiation
but it’s fair to put the specific base augmentor in utils
even though it’s just used in that lesson
 Yh, I get
side note
passport folder in Passport Project has util
make sense to use that?

 we still have this error
NameResolutionError("<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection 
 in which context? a little lost
maybe you should call. this chat is really bitty and I kinda wanta start
getting a coffee brb
 Ok, when you get back

 Hi Joe
kindly recheck
the code
 fine
set aux value was a good abstraction
I didn’t think of that
 there’s a followup to that hyperion pubsub fix if you’re itnerested
 Oh
whats it about
//accesso.atlassian.net/browse/DSTBACK-3950

DSTBACK-3950 hyperion unite pubsub
Status: Ready for DEV
Type: Bug
Assignee: Joseph Grimer
Priority: P4 - Minor
More actions...
Añadido por Jira Cloud
 Thanks, would jump on it after my break
 n.b. involves generating a service account probably
and putting it on dogbert
Se ha realizado una junta Tú y //console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?orgonly=true&project=tsw-develop
 2 years. congrats!

 on the newsletter
 Thanks Man
seems Divya is out
I am checking on Shannon
to see if she has the access\
 whiule you’re waiting… actually I can’t think of anything. that’s really the blcoker on this ticket
 THe meeting feels like something is missing
see why we need Sarah
 naa… voids create growth
 i got this
-bash: sudo: command not found
is it fine if i installsudo
 sudo is not on bsd
don’t install sudo
(I think I can add the word ever, but there are almost always execptions)
also never say the word sudo to pete… he’ll start typing faster :P
 haha noted
i did su root
it fixed it
 yup. you got it

 call by reference
 call by value
 vs call by value
 may be worth restarting fluentd after making sure that newline is gone and trying a resent
resend*
 done
i can see it in the hyperion pub sub log
 ah?
now check spool
 how did you decrypt this

... Part of the problem is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulation that forced the industry to increase it's reliance on automated flying. But, thankfully, the same FAA finally figured out the problem; it has recently found that pilots often "abdicate too much responsibility to automated systems."
 I agree
automation makes individual loose important technical skills
which could be a threat to modern civilisation
 yh, but he’s making a different point
a much closer threat
you’re talking about the Kazinski threat
but taleb is talking about the right now how people function with too much help threat
much more immediate
if you give a guy a walking stick when he’s close to being able to walk, he takes longer to start walking alone
if you give a programmer too much help, he actually disengages
why is watching a video so much less effective than reading a book? That’s the mystery
kinda like using Shazam
fentanyl for the mind
 I totally agree
too much. help
stifles growth
 please resend the PR you mentioned
One idea for making a bit of progress on the hyperion ticket: Try and use those pubsub creds you put on dogbert to post to the feed manually
 I meant your PR
 my PR do I have a PR?
//github.com/ingresso-group/rattatosk/pull/687
We forgot Shannon!
 is that the right PR?
ah, you’re waiting for me to merge it
ok. How much are you rushed? IO can prioritise?
 I would appreciate if you priortise it
 Hi Joe
seems you have pushed it
 yh. dunno if pete made it live on dogbert yet
if he didn’t I can
can you see it?
here’s a sample request to speed things up
 yes
its live
curious question
i looked through the code
didnt find where you specified the method name  ListReportingGroups
 ah good question
and the answer should help you in all future cases
so somewhere in the depths of core
there is a macro, or some meta code
that translates function names that look like this:
- (PFArray*)jsonRpcListReportingGroupsForId:(PFString*)anId
into jsonrpc calls called in this case: ListReportingGroups
 there is a macro, or some meta code doesnt it get committed
 does that make sense?
 ooohhhh
 I can show you if you like. feel free to call
