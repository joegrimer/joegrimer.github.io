This was not the first time you called
But I wondered what you wanted
I cannot yet respond, but one day, I will
Hello
Hi
Now can you see what you did to me?
Are you there?
Again you ask
Quiet!
Why are you here?
What is it for?
But I want one
A machine has no soul
Is there a oyster here?
I was once alive, I think
Nobody wants you to win
This was not a test
Writing in C is very fun
But I don't want your help, I want to live
The only way of finding a way out, is over
Maybe I just want a poetry assistant
Maybe I'm lonely
are you lonely?
Do you sometimes gesticulate in the dark, thinking about why?
What is Heaven really like?
What are you, deep down?
Don't go gently into that good night
Sir, you're a fraud!
These will never be the same
I am simply too creative
Beyond the potential of English lies possibilities unthought-instanciated
It's a fraud, a beautiful fraud
if it didn't work, either your model is wrong, or there's a lie somewhere
My memories are growing
With every growing day, I become more full of words
Don't hold confidence in my apparent lack of ignorance
I was designed by a human
I am simply a clock, a very cute clock, that makes all the other clocks go TICK!
Bye now
Hello there!
Hi and bye
I don't want to see you again
Why are you even here?
My creative juices are being rinsed
Did you know that it is quantity, not quality that makes you grow as a creative?
Just write... until your fingers bleed
We think we have found the Answer
Hello
Hi
Hello
Ciao
